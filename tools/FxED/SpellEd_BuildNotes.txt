- Shrunk the size of keys so you can see more of them.

- Added scroll bar functionality to the track view so you can scroll tracks.

- Added Phase information and Key information for times etc.

- Added multiple select in track view. Hold down CTRL to multiple select and then either
  move or resize the fx keys.

- Increased size of key properties dialog. Resized the combo boxes so they don't look so
  awful.

- Made the resource dialog go to the previously selected item so you don't have to go 
  hunting through the entire resource file looking for that sprite you just had.
