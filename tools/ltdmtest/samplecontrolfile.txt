;

; number of intensities that are defined
NUMINTENSITIES 6

; initial intensity to start playing (use 0 for none)
INITIALINTENSITY 0

; optional volume to set music playback to (default is 0) volume is in 100ths of a decibal and can be negative or positive
; negative numbers reduce the volume and positive numbers increase the volume
INITIALVOLUME 0

; number of pchannels to use
PCHANNELS 32

; number of voices to use
VOICES 32

; sample rate for synthesizer to run at
SYNTHSAMPLERATE 44100

; reverb can be either on or off. Default is OFF.
REVERB off

; specify the reverb Input Gain in decibels. The default value is 0. This value is a floating point value.
REVERBINGAIN 0.0

; specify the reverb Mix in decibels. The default value is -10.0. A value of 0 means 100 percent wet reverb 
; (no direct signal). This value is a floating point value.
REVERBMIX -10.0

; Specify reverb decay time, in milliseconds. The default value is 1000. This value is a floating point value.
REVERBTIME 1000.0

; Specify reverb RBTime value. Ratio of the high frequencies to the global reverb time. Unless very bright 
; reverbs are wanted, this should be set to a value less than 1. The default value is 0.001. This value is a 
; loating point value.
REVERBHIGHFREQRTRATIO 0.001

; Specify the directory to read all dls banks that don't have a path explictly defined
DLSBANKDIRECTORY \music\dls

; downloadable sound banks (.DLS) to load (you can specify any number of these)
; there is no need to list the dls banks because they are specified inside the other
; objectes it actually screws things up if you declare them so don't do it!
; DLSBANK sanity3dls.dls

; downloadable sound banks (.STY) to load (you can specify any number of these)
; STYLE sanity3sty.sty

; name of bands to use (you can specify any number of these) (these are contained in the styles)
; format : BAND <style name> <band name>
BAND sanity3sty.sty Sanity3Band

; chordmaps to load (you can specify any number of these)
CHORDMAP samplechrd.crd
CHORDMAP samplechrd2.crd

;
; intensity definitions 
; 
; format is INTENSITY <intensity number> <times to loop (-1 for infinite loop)> <intensity to switch to when finished or 0 for stop> [any number of segments]
;
INTENSITY	1		-1		1		cello3.sgt, rage1.sgt, cello3.sgt
INTENSITY	2		-1		0		rage1.sgt, rage2.sgt, rage3.sgt, rage4.sgt

INTENSITY	6		1		0		cello3.sgt, prime1.sgt

;
; Transitions (only transitions that are not going to use MEASURE MANUAL with no transition segment
;			   need to be defined)
;
; format is TRANSITION <from intensity> <to intensity> <when to enact transition> <automatic or manual> [optional segment to play if manual] [optional chordmap if automatic]
;
;	when to enact transition = SEGMENT, MEASURE, BEAT, IMMEDIATE, GRID, DEFAULT (defined in segment)
;
;	automatic or manual = AUTOMATIC for directmusic automatic transition, MANUAL for manual playing of transition segments (if no 
;						  transitions are specified for manual then no transition happens new intensity just starts playing)
;
TRANSITION	1	2	SEGMENT		MANUAL		trans1.sgt
TRANSITION	4	1	SEGMENT		MANUAL 
TRANSITION	2	3	BEAT		MANUAL		trans2.sgt

; secondary segments to preload (you can specify any number of these)
