# LithTech Jupiter
My own personal changes/modifications of the LithTech Jupiter Game Engine (Enterprise Build 69)

Currently only Windows is supported!

# Requirements
- zlib (you can get it from vcpkg)
- freetype (you can get it from vcpkg)
- A C++ compiler
- CMake 3.20+
- Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)

# Building
1. Generate the project with CMake (remember to specify -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_DIR to the vcpkg path in case)
2. Simply build LithTech.sln
